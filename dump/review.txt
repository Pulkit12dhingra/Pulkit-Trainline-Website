trainline's website is very complex and everything is related to one another and clubbed together in a single html file
I don't know if in any case they have to update something or change some design how will they do it.
I tried to extract certain classes and even entire html but was unsuccessful. 
I was facing issues aligning the text and images and with CSS they have, I don't think it will be easy to understand everything and update the code
or eeven pin-point certain things in the code.
Thus to speed up the process, I will be developing the entire website on my own, using the design inspirations from the original site

Let's see how that goes
